# SEIR_CT

Modelling the control of SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, the novel coronavirus, "rona."

# Assumptions
* Age, Gender, and Race are not contributing factors
* Testing is sufficient to capture all cases. Testing does not lag.
* Implementation of control is instantaneous. There is no time lag between compartments.
