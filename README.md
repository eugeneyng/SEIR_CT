# SEIR_CT

Modelling the control of SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, the novel coronavirus, "rona."

# Assumptions
* Age is not taken into account [i.e. x(t) != x(t,a)]
* Hospitalization/ICU rates are not taken into account
* The average incubation period is a random variable with exponential distribution with parameter a (the average incubation period is a^-1)
