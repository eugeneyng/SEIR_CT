# Assumptions
* The natural rate is equal to the natural death rate
* Age is not taken into account x(t) != x(t,a)
* Hospitalization/ICU rates are not taken into account
* The average incubation period is a random variable with exponential distribution with parameter a (the average incubation period is a^-1)
